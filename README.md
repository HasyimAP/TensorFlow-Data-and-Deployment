# TensorFlow Data and Deployment

This repository is a documentation for all of my assignment code, including the raw code for the specialization certification "TensorFlow: Data and Deployment" on Coursera *(Code only, no quizzes)*



### IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
#### The code provided in this repository is only for helping those who may get stuck at any point of time in the course. It is strongly advised that no one should just copy the solutions (violation of Coursera Honor Code) presented here.

## About this Specialization

Continue developing your skills in TensorFlow as you learn to navigate through a wide range of deployment scenarios and discover new ways to use data more effectively when training your machine learning models.

In this four-course Specialization, youâ€™ll learn how to get your machine learning models into the hands of real people on all kinds of devices. Start by understanding how to train and run machine learning models in browsers and in mobile applications. Learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, learn about data pipelines with TensorFlow data services, use APIs to control data splitting, process all types of unstructured data, and retrain deployed models with user data while maintaining data privacy.  Apply your knowledge in various deployment scenarios and get introduced to TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow, Hub, TensorBoard, and more.
